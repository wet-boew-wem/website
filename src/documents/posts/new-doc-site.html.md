For the last little while we have been using the wiki related functionality that GitHub provides.

However there were more then a few cumbersome issues with using this provided feature that made updating the documentation a bit of a hassle.

Thankfully we now have DocPad on the scene to help us out so we can deliver better quality documentation faster!

DocPad is a next generation static site generator for developers that lets you create fast websites with dynamic abilities and powerful abstractions.

We hope to add content to this website weekly so please check back in a few days.
