After an exhaustive amount of testing and work we have finally pushed our last release candidate 7.x-1.0-rc22 out the door.

What this now means is that likely within the week of Oct 29th, 2013 we will have our first official release of Drupal WxT.

You can help speed this along by reviewing our latest release candidate and filing any additional issues over at http://drupal.org/project/wetkit.

Should the issue queue remain stable with not too many problems reported with our latest release candidate then we will update all of our custom modules / themes to stable git hashes and release our first stable version!
